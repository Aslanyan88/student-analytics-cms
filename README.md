- MySQL database
- Yarn (optional, but recommended)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd student-system
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and update the values

4. Set up the database:

   yarn db:push
   ```

5. Start the development servers:
   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```

### Development Workflow

- Frontend development server runs on `http://localhost:3000`
- Backend API server runs on `http://localhost:3001`

## API Reference

The backend provides the following API endpoints:

### Authentication

- `POST /api/auth/register` - Register a new user
- `POST /api/auth/login` - Log in a user

- `POST /api/auth/reset-password/:token` - Reset password

### Classrooms

- `GET /api/classrooms` - Get all classrooms
- `GET /api/classrooms/:id` - Get a specific classroom
- `POST /api/classrooms` - Create a new classroom
- `PUT /api/classrooms/:id` - Update a classroom
- `DELETE /api/classrooms/:id` - Delete a classroom
- `POST /api/classrooms/:id/teachers` - Add a teacher to a classroom
- `POST /api/classrooms/:id/students` - Add a student to a classroom

### Assignments

- `GET /api/assignments` - Get all assignments
- `GET /api/assignments/:id` - Get a specific assignment
- `POST /api/assignments` - Create a new assignment
- `PUT /api/assignments/:id` - Update an assignment
- `DELETE /api/assignments/:id` - Delete an assignment
- `POST /api/assignments/:id/submit` - Submit an assignment (student)
- `PUT /api/assignments/:id/grade` - Grade an assignment (teacher)

### Activity Logs

- `GET /api/activity-logs` - Get all activity logs
- `POST /api/activity-logs` - Create a new activity log
- `GET /api/activity-logs/attendance` - Get attendance records
- `POST /api/activity-logs/attendance` - Log attendance

### Notifications

- `GET /api/users/:id` - Get a specific user
- `PUT /api/users/:id` - Update a user
- `DELETE /api/users/:id` - Delete a user (admin only)

## Deployment

The application can be deployed using various methods:

### Traditional Deployment

1. Build the applications:
   ```bash
   yarn build
   ```

2. Start the production servers:
   ```bash
   yarn start
   ```

## Architecture Design

The system follows a microservices-inspired architecture with separate frontend and backend applications that communicate through REST APIs. The database layer is managed through Prisma ORM to provide type safety and migrations.

### Data Flow

1. Client makes a request to the Next.js frontend
2. Frontend communicates with the backend API
3. Backend handles authentication, business logic, and data access
4. Prisma ORM communicates with the MySQL database
5. Data flows back through the same layers to the client

## Testing

Run tests with:

```bash
yarn test
```

The project includes:
- Unit tests for utility functions
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- End-to-end tests for critical user flows
